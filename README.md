# Ethereum Development with Go

English | **[简体中文](README_zh.md)**

## Overview

This note is fork from the [ethereum-development-with-go-book](https://github.com/miguelmota/ethereum-development-with-go-book), discarding old code based on the original author's Based on the new version of Geth updated with code cases as well as new functional code, and new functional code cases added on subsequent new features based on multiple EVM chains; as well as adding new defi projects and other knowledge such as Subgraph, DeFi, etc. to add a bit more comprehensiveness.

To give an overview to any students who want to use Go for Ether development. The intention is that if you already have some familiarity with Ether and Go, but are still a bit clueless about how to combine the two, then this book is a good starting point. You'll learn how to interact with smart contracts using Go, as well as how to do some everyday queries and tasks.
